Townhall
========

Townhall is a web-application for creating a place where citizens can take an
active role in their local governments online.

To start, it will be a place where citizens can find videos of local meetings
and annotate them as they watch allowing others to flip between parts of
interest and drawing connections from other documents and meetings.
